*/



Here is the list of actions you will have to do to upgrade from any previous version :

Caution : 
For those who want to keep the classical mimetype's manager, 
don't upload /class, /kernel and /language directory/files from the module's archive

1) Upload all files in this package, overwriting the existing files.
2) Update the module in system admin -> modules


if you use modxoopsinfo 1.0 or 1.1, you can uninstal this one through module administration panel.
