    <p><b>Q:</b> I couldn’t find any related issues by searching what next? <br>
        <br>
        <b>A:</b> Please use an effective title for the post; this assists other users to answer you who have had a similar problem. Many users will not be attracted to a "please help me I have a problem" title. A relevant title also helps other users find solutions to their problems. <br>
        <br>
        Posts like "I have a blank page" will generally be ignored. Not because we don’t want to help, but because we can’t with such a small amount of information. <br>
        <br>
        The best way to start your request for support is to use a clear, descriptive title and to explain the problems you are having in as much detail as possible. If you are having problems with a module and/or theme, be sure to list the name and version of the module and/or theme.</p>

    <p><b>Turn on debug:</b><br>
        To switch on debug, go to system admin-->preferences and then general settings. You will see a "Debug mode" field. Choose "PHP Debug". Then go to the page that has problems and copy and paste any error messages under php-debug messages in the template below. Do this for each debug type (PHP,
        MySQL, Smarty). <br>
        <br>
        PHP Debug Messages:<br>
        MySQL Debug Messages:<br>
        Smarty Debug Messages:<br>
